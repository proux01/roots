(** [N] contains an [order] tactic for natural numbers *)

(** Note that [N.order] is domain-agnostic: it will not prove
    [1<=2] or [x<=x+x], but rather things like [x<=y -> y<=x -> x=y]. *)

Local Open Scope N_scope.

Section TestOrder.
 Let test : forall x y, x<=y -> y<=x -> x=y.
 Proof.
 N.order.
 Defined.
End TestOrder.
